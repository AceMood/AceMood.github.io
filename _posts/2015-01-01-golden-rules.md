Be yourself, do not follow if you feel uncomfortable.

Do not believe in what you have not confirmed.

Be politely whenever, except the other is Sha.Bi.

Everyone is more or less selfish, keep near with the ones who like you.

Life is short, do whatever you want.

To be the important one.

Do not waste time any more. It's very very expensive.
