> These tools were less negatively received than the older versions. By December 2010 I started open sourcing them; Haste became Celerity and Alite became Aphront. I wrote Maniphest to track open issues with the project in January or February and we open sourced Phabricator in late April, shortly after I left Facebook.

# Preface

__It can be a really big topic, I confirm that it not only contains issue like development, debugging, testing, feedback, performance, also build workflow, static resource management, security and so on. We now will have a glance at Build Tools and Performance.__

# Fragmented code

Nowadays, we write more and more Front-end code in the page. We may include external javascript and stylesheet more than 
one hundred files in one page at any position. 

For example,
``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="navbar.css" />
<div class="navbar">
    <div class="navbar__title"></div>
    <div class="navbar__list">
        <ul>
        <ul>
    </div>
</div>
<script src="navbar.js"></script>
```
